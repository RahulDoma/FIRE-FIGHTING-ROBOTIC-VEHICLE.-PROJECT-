PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
The security of home, laboratory, office, factory and building 
is important to human life. We develop an intelligent multi 
sensor based security system that contains a fire fighting 
robot in our daily life. 
It is because security system canâ€™t detect abnormal and 
dangerous situation and notify us. 
User may take a late time to extinguish fire like finding the 
water source to extinguish fire when want to extinguish the 
f
 ire.This robot also programmed to stop before the robot hit 
the flames.


ABSTRACT: 
User may take much time to extinguish fire like finding the water  
source to extinguish fire when we want to extinguish the fire. 
This robot will move to the fire source where the flame sensor detects the 
f
 ire and it will send message to any phone of the GSM network through the 
modem connected to the programmable device. 
This robot is equipped with 3 flame sensors where each sensor has its own 
function and commanded control. User may take more time to extinguish fire, like finding 
the water source to extinguish fire when we want to extinguish the fire. 
But few small fire incidents may be hard to detect. 
This Fire Protection Robot design with extinguisher for the intelligent 
building to be controlled by microcontroller PIC18F4550 and supported by 
autonomous board CYTRON SK40C board and another additional circuit.
